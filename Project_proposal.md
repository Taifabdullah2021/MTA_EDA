##

The top 2 popular holidays in the USA are **Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays** (based on [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/3216/national-holidays-in-the-us/)). Christmas holiday is celebrated by exchanging gifts, sharing food with all family members and friends and gathreing family members together. Therefore, people who celebrate them will use subways as an option to reach out to their families and friends. So, MTA requested a data analysis to help them optimize the crowd mangement during Christmas 2019.

## Who benefits from analysis 

MTA turnstile stations can benefit from this analysis in:
- Solve the under-staffing problems if exist  
- Prepare for the increase in number of people
- Avoid and prepare for possible accidents

## Dataset description

### **MTA Turnstile Data** ([Source](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)) :

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is North America's largest transportation network, serving a population of 15.3 million people across a 5,000-square-mile travel area surrounding New York City through Long Island, southeastern New York State, and Connecticut.

The MTA network comprises the nationâ€™s largest bus fleet and more subway and commuter rail cars than all other U.S. transit systems combined. The MTA's operating agencies are MTA 
New York City Transit, MTA Bus, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and MTA Bridges and Tunnels.

## Tools 

- SQLAlchemy in python (Querying the data)
- Pandas and Numpy (Exploring the data)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (Visualizing the data)
- Other tools may be used during the execution of the data analysis

## MVP Goal

this project will be delivered at the end of week 2 as a project 1 for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, the project will include the following :

- Final report that include the all the steps I took to finish this project
- Final EDA code
- Data base of the MTA turnstile data
- Presentation explaining the summary of the project
